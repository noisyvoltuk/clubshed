# A starting point

The obvious starting point to maitianing the water level in a pond must be soem reliable way of sensign the actual water level

Considerations
- Accuracy
- Robustness
- Maintenenance

Solution options:
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Pressure sensor
- Conductivity sensor

It seems to be that both ultrasonic and conductivity methods may be subject to conditions, cleanliness etc.

A pressure sensor may also have the advantage of being easier to conceal.
